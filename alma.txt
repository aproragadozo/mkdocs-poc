## A header, for no real reason

2. This is some content that I'd like to include in some other files:

    ![alt-text](img/test-image.jpg)

3. Let's see if code works:

    ```python
    class Person:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

      def myfunc(self):
        print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
    ```
