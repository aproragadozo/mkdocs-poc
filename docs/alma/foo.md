```python
def is_prime:

    num = 407

    # take input from the user
    # num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    # prime numbers are greater than 1
    if num > 1:
    # check for factors
    for i in range(2,num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num,"is not a prime number")
            print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
            break
    else:
        print(num,"is a prime number")

    # if input number is less than
    # or equal to 1, it is not prime
    else:
    print(num,"is not a prime number")
